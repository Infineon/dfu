# Device Firmware Update (DFU) Middleware Library 5.2

## What's Included?

For a complete description of the DFU middleware, refer to [README.md](./README.md)
and the [DFU API Reference](https://infineon.github.io/dfu/html/index.html).
The revision history of the DFU middleware is also available in the [API Reference Changelog](https://infineon.github.io/dfu/html/index.html#group_dfu_changelog).
New in this release:

* Added USB HID transport based on the emUSB-Device middleware for the CAT1A device
* Added CANFD transport based on the PDL driver for the CAT1C device
* Minor updates in the templates

**Note** Device Firmware Update Host Tool 2.20 does not support CANFD transport. The CANFD support is planned to be added later.

## Defect Fixes

* Fixed address validation for CAT1C device

## Known Issues

No known issues
