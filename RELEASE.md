# Device Firmware Update (DFU) Middleware Library 5.1

## What's Included?

For a complete description of the DFU middleware, refer to [README.md](./README.md)
and the [DFU API Reference](https://infineon.github.io/dfu/html/index.html).
The revision history of the DFU middleware is also available in the [API Reference Changelog](https://infineon.github.io/dfu/html/index.html#group_dfu_changelog).
New in this release:

* Added USB CDC transport based on the emUSB-Device middleware for the CAT1A device
* Minor updates in the templates

## Defect Fixes

* Corrected the name of the UART object used in the cyhal_uart_set_baud() function. Now, works correctly the custom baud rate configuring in the UART transport.

## Known Issues

No known issues

## Supported Software and Tools

This version of the DFU middleware was validated for compatibility with the following Software and Tools (add and remove information as needed):
